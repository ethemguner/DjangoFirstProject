# Django First Project
My first project in Django. A e-commerce website. Live at http://ethemguner.pythonanywhere.com

# About Website
It's very simple. I'm trying to understand Django web development. 

This website is actually very functional. You can login and create 
a user profile. It takes adress & phone number information to use shipping (after registiration in settings page).

Changing password is available.

Permissions've adjusted. For example, If you're not superuser you cannot add a product, delete a product or edit a product. On the other hand
If you're not login you cannot add product to your cart.

You can add product to your shopping list. You can see added product(s) in your cart list page. Also in cart list, there is total price.
In cart list, adress and phone number are listing. If adress or phone numer information isn't adjusted, It gives a message about that
and gives a link to settings page to adjust the adress and phone number.

Every user has a cart list. (I really tried so hard to do this. I believe there are some problems about that but for now everything
seems very stable.)

For superuser, adding-deleting-editing product available.
